# C4 New Website

This is a new website for (C4)[https://cornellcollegecomputingclub.github.io/index.html]! This is using the static site generator (Zola)[https://www.getzola.org/], instead of raw HTML.

## What will be different?

* Blogs now use Markdown instead of HTML.
* Images now use Git LFS.
* Tiny styling details. (Hopefully not too many.)

## When will this be done?

Soonâ„¢
